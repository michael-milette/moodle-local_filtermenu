# Basic Overview

# Troubleshooting

### Why are my tags not filtered in my menu?

1. Ensure that the tags you are trying to filter start with { and end with } such as {filtercodes} and {mlang}.
2. Ensure that your Moodle filters are enabled and set to filter headings and content.

There are no known issues that we know of at this time. However, despite our efforts, the unexpected does happen. Please report bugs to https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-local_filtermenu/issues

# FAQ

## Frequently Asked Questions

IMPORANT: Although we expect everything to work, this ALPHA release is still in development and has not been fully tested in every situation. If you find a problem, please help by reporting it in the [Bug Tracker](http://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-local_filtermenu/issues).

### {FilterMenu} Why are tags displayed as entered instead of being converted to data?

Here are a few things you can check:
* Make sure the plugin is installed and that you have visited the Notifications page to update the database. See installation instructions.
