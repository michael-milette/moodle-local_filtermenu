# Basic Overview

FilterMenu for Moodle applies Moodle filters to the custom menu and custom user menu enabling administrators to easily customize and personalize the site using plain text tags such as FilterCodes and other filter type plugins for Moodle.

IMPORTANT: Although we expect everything to work, this ALPHA release is still in development and has not been fully tested in every situation. If you find a problem, please help by reporting it in the [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-local_filtermenu/issues).

# Usage

IMPORANT: Although we expect everything to work, this ALPHA release is still in development and has not been fully tested in every situation. If you find a problem, please help by reporting it in the [Bug Tracker](http://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-local_filtermenu/issues).

There are no configurable settings for this plugin at this time.

## Custom menus with FilterMenu and FilterCodes

Here is a link to some examples of how to create really useful custom menus using FilterMenu and FilterCodes
https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes#filtercodes-in-a-custom-menu

Once both plugins are installed and activated, just copy and paste the code into the **Custom menu items** field (Site administration > Appearance > Theme settings)

Feel free to customize these for your own needs and to make more of these for other roles like Course creators, Teachers, Teacher assistants and even Students.

**Doesn't work?** If FilterMenu doesn't work with your theme, contact the developer / maintainer of the theme and encourage theme to enable support for Moodle filters in the custom menus.
